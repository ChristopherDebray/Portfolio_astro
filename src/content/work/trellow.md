### Why this project ?

Having work for some time with VueJS i wanted to try out NuxtJS.
Althougth this isn't a complex project, it still allowed me to test the framework.

### What aspects of interest ?

- <span class="title">Libraries</span> : VueUse is widely spread, providing a great collection of composition utilities.
- <span class="title">Expreriment</span> : Even if i had used the Drag and Drop web API with javascript to create drag and drops, it isn't something I do regularly for work, yet it is a very usefull feature.
- <span class="title">Ideas</span> : This project is partly what gave me the idea to create my task management project, in the future i would love to add this trello like functionality on it.

### Features

- Create or delete a task
- Create task type column
- Hability to reorganize tasks or columns
- Hability to duplicate a task by holding ALT while dragging an element
