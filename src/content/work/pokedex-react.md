## React, stuff

> Having a first exeprience with VueJS, I wanted to try React and some of it's iconic libraries.

### Why this project ?

This project was based on a technical test from a friend company. I didn't know a lot about React but having a sketch and a goal for a project was enough to get me started, plus i had some libraries i wanted to try.

### What aspects of interest ?

- <span class="title">Environment setup</span> : I wanted to learn CI/CD, here i used gitlabCI for it for the first time.
- <span class="title">Testing</span> : It was not my first time doing testing on front-end side, but it had been a while so i was more than happy to relish the opportunity.
- <span class="title">Storybook</span> : It is a very powerfull and usefull library, i love it even if didn't use it's testing
