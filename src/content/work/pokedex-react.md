## React and it's many tools.

> Having a first exeprience with VueJS, I wanted to try React and some of it's iconic libraries.

### Why this project ?

I had tested React on my first formation but it was the first framework I used and it was a on a week-end so it wasn't a great experience, therefore I wanted to try give it another go.
This project was based on a technical test from a friend company. I didn't know a lot about React but having a sketch and a goal for a project was enough to get me started, plus i had some libraries i wanted to try.

### What aspects of interest ?

- <span class="title">Libraries</span> : Clearly there are lots of great libraries in react, but there are some that are iconic like <strong>Storybook</strong>, <strong>Emotion</strong> or <strong>React Hook Form</strong>.
- <span class="title">Testing</span> : It wasn't my first time doing testing on front-end side, but it had been a while so i was more than happy to relish the opportunity.
- <span class="title">Storybook</span> : It is a very powerfull and usefull library, i love it.
